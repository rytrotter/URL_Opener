# URL_Opener
A tool for you to start when you have your computer up and someone sends you a URL on your phone. If you want to open it on your computer, just text the Twilio number and it will open on your computer with this running.


You will need to add your own Twilio Account SID, Twilio Authentication Token, Ngrok Authentication Token, and path to your geckodriver file (in the resources folder). These will be in URLOpener.py.

In start_ngrok.bat, you will need to add the path to the ngrok application (also in resources folder).
